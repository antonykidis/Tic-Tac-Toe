</br>
<div>This project also contains a single tic-tac-toe.cs file which is an original
code by Bradley L Jones, from Teach Yourself C# In 21 Days book.<br>
Originally this game was written using Single file where logic, and design were embeded in a single file.<br>
In this book you were compiling the files and getting the (.exe) out of it using a standalone C# compiler.<br>
You can still use the single code file by compiling it, or just build a run the solution.
   In Case you still want to compile a single file, follow these steps:<br>
1. Download external C# Compiler from https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/windows/ <br>
2. Open "OpenCommandPromt.exe" type csc tic-tac-toe.cs and press Enter.
This will generate tic-tac-toe.exe file.<br>
3. Open tic-tac-toe.exe to play the game.<br>

IMPORTANT!<br>
Before you Compile the tic-tac-toe.cs, Uncomment the Main() method at line 266 to make it work. <br>
The Main() method was commented in purpose to override compilation errors in the main project.<br><br>
Main Project<br>
The main project was written from scratch using a separation of Design, and Logic.<br>
1.Program.cs file Contains Main() method, which is the main enttry of the programm.<br>
2.TicTacToeFinal.cs Contains All the logic needed for the game.<br>
3.TicTacToeFinal.Designer.cs Contains InitializeComponent() method where all the Design code is located<br>
